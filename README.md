# when-does-next-period-end

Find out when the next period will end in CVHS!!

To run, open `index.html` in your browser. 

This program uses Bootstrap! See them [here](https://www.getbootstrap.com/).

### How to access previous versions
#### Do the following steps for each file
1. Check `changelog.md` to see what bugs you may encounter while using the version.
2. Go to commit history and find the latest commit that says `Version (insert version number here) edits`.
    - Not every file gets updated in every update. If the current file wasn't updated on the update you are looking for, look for the update that precedes the update you are looking for.
3. Download the file.
